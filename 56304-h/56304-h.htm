<h2 id="c1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>This paper is primarily planned for the layman, the beginning student
of prehistory and others interested in acquiring a general understanding
of how primitive man lived during his successive occupations
of Illinois and neighboring areas in the more important archaeological
periods. Most of the archaeological data for the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a> cultures or ways
of life are given in references in the accompanying bibliography of technical
publications selected as those from which (in the opinion of the
writer) the information can be most easily gleaned.</p>
<p>The reconstructions given of the cultural features, where not those
ordinarily inferred from archaeological findings, are based on a study of
the practices commonly found among <a class="gloss" href="#g_PrimitivePeople">primitive people</a> now, or until
recently, living in the same <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Substage">substage</a>. These are tentative conclusions
resulting from a study of fifty tribes in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SelfDomestication">Self-Domestication</a>
(pre-farming) stage and forty in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_PlantRaising">Plant-Raising</a> substage. Because
primitive tribes which are under pressure from <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> with
advanced food-draft-animal agriculture or with machine industry or which are in
a transitional condition between two adjacent stages are disorganized
or drastically changing a formerly stabilized mode of life, great care has
been exercised in drawing general conclusions from their cultural features.</p>
<p>The reconstructions of the perishable objects shown in the drawings
are generally in keeping with the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> in which they are exhibited
but cannot be vouched for as to their detailed form. The handle
of an adze, the shape of a cabin roof, the headdress of a tribal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a>
each served the purpose for which they were made and their exact form
was and is of no more consequence in the culture than the fashions in
women&rsquo;s hats or the fins on an automobile are in our own. The details
in cultures serve to set them apart from each other; it is the basic and
significant features and subfeatures that determine relationships and
permit the most useful classification.</p>
<p>The study mentioned above is still incomplete, but results so far
obtained indicate:</p>
<p class="revint">1. That man in the same <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a> (and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Substage">substage</a>) of cultural development
<i>tends</i> to invent and employ the same broad social and spiritual features,
regardless of surroundings.</p>
<p class="revint">2. That where significant differences arise between substages of the
same <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a>, they are (at least sometimes) linked with peculiarities
of climate and/or natural resources which the <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> have seized
upon and exploited to the improvement of their economic situation.</p>
<p class="revint">3. That many details within these broad types of economic, social and
spiritual features appear to vary unpredictably within the range of
available possibilities.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_6">6</div>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a> and criterion for each were proposed in an earlier issue
(No. 6) of this series, <i>Man&rsquo;s Venture In <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">Culture</a></i>, (Deuel 1950, pp. 5-12)
as:</p>
<p class="revint">1. <i>Natural Man</i> (<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Protocultural">Protocultural</a></i>), when &ldquo;man&rdquo; presumably employed
sticks and stones as implements and weapons.</p>
<p class="revint">2. <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_SelfDomestication">Self-Domestication</a></i>, following the discovery of the principle of the
conchoidal fracturing of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a> and its control, and the invention of
tool and weapon types.</p>
<p class="revint">3. <i>Farming</i> or <i>Food-Raising</i>, due to the discovery that grains (grasses)
and food-draft animals could be bred and raised in captivity.</p>
<p class="revint">4. <i>Inanimate Power Machine</i> (<i>Machine Age</i>), after the discovery of the
availability of water and wind as sources for energy and the adaptation
of animal-driven machines to utilize them.</p>
<p>Man in the wild or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Protocultural">Protocultural</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a> is thought not to have
reached the Americas. The oxlike mammals were not domesticated in
America for drawing ploughs and vehicles, turning grain mills or to
serve as a continuous food supply source. Consequently, we are concerned
in the following discussion only with peoples in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_SelfDomestication">Self-Domestication</a>
stage and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_PlantRaising">Plant-Raising</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Substage">substage</a> of Farming.</p>
<p>In ordinary language, the word &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>&rdquo; is used in a diversity of
senses. In these pages it is used in one of two ways, the one employed
being readily understood from the context. In a general sense, culture
means the significant beliefs, customary activities and social prohibitions
that are peculiar to man (together with the man-made tools, weapons
and other material objects that he finds or has found necessary) that
modify, limit or enhance in some manner, most of his discernible
natural activities due to and arising from his physical animal inheritance
and organization. Culture in a specific sense refers to the significant
cultural features of a group or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> under consideration.</p>
<p>For convenience, any cultural activity according to its dominant
purpose may be spoken of as belonging to one of three aspects of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>,
(a) economic (technological and intellectual); (b) social (and
political); and (c) spiritual (religious, artistic and recreational). To
lesser degrees, most cultural activities have relationships with the two
aspects other than the dominant.</p>
<p>Certain prevalent archaeological designations have been changed
to remove time implications (e.g. &ldquo;early&rdquo; and &ldquo;late&rdquo; <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> to
<i>Initial</i> [beginning] and <i>Final</i> [end of an archaeological series]), or to
shorten (e.g. &ldquo;Tennessee-Cumberland&rdquo; or &ldquo;Gordon-Fewkes&rdquo; to <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Cumberland">Cumberland</a></i>).</p>
<p>Technical terms have generally been avoided; but where it has
seemed necessary to retain them or to use words in a special sense, they
are explained in the text or can be found in the glossary. The terms
<i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Pattern">pattern</a></i> and <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a></i> are those generally employed in the McKern system
of classification, for the larger groupings into which it is customary to
<span class="pb" id="Page_7">7</span>
place the &ldquo;cultures&rdquo; as determined from the typology of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a>,
their association in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Assemblage">assemblage</a> and pertinent data recovered at a
site (or local community) with due regard to circumstances of time and
location of other sites nearby and over a larger area. The largest unit is
the <i>pattern</i> which is made up of a number of <i>phases</i>. Cultural divisions
smaller than these units are spoken of here as <i>subcultures</i>.</p>
<p>The approximate relationships of the archaeological units to the
broader cultural stages and substages are given in Table I, <a href="#Page_4">page 4</a>. The
succession and coexistence of the archaeological units is indicated in the
diagram &ldquo;The Stream of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">Culture</a>&rdquo;, <a href="#Page_57">p. 57</a>. The summary of &ldquo;Characteristics
of the Archaeological-Cultural Units&rdquo; occurs on pages <a href="#Page_70">70</a>-76.</p>
<p>This is a story mainly of Illinois when occupied by American Indians
but it would not give a reasonably true picture without showing
the known extensions of some of the cultures into surrounding areas
and the probable intrusions from outside the state.</p>
<p>Of necessity in attempting a summary of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> of Illinois
and adjacent areas, the writer has had to lean heavily on the field work
and reports of the many anthropologists who have contributed so much
to the present understanding of the American Indian in the United
States. To this invaluable source material and to these able scientists
the indebtedness of the writer is acknowledged to be very great indeed.
In the compass of a work of this type it is impossible to name them or
give them credit for original or similar views, nor is it practicable to
include in the bibliography all the publications used.</p>
<p>Acknowledgment of assistance is made especially to Georg K.
Neumann, Joseph R. Caldwell and Melvin L. Fowler, Milton D.
Thompson, Ruth Kerr, Nora Deuel and Orvetta Robinson for reading
and discussing the manuscript from various viewpoints, to Dr. James
B. Griffin for helpful information on the dates of sites and of archaeological
data, to Irvin Peithmann, Southern Illinois University, for photographs
furnished, for information on sites he had discovered and
the privilege of visiting them in his company, to George Langford for
photographs and data regarding the Fisher site, to Charles Hodge for
all photographs reproduced not otherwise credited, and to Jerry Connolly,
Bettye Broyles, Barbara Parmalee and Jeanne McCarty for their
excellent drawings. Without all this considerable and valuable aid the
publication could not have been completed.</p>

<h2 id="c2">PALEO-INDIANS, BIG GAME HUNTERS, DISCOVER A NEW WORLD (50,000? to 8,000? B.C.)<a class="fn" id="fr_5" href="#fn_5">[5]</a></h2>
<p>Man probably discovered America as early as 50,000 years ago and
gradually occupied the two continents in the succeeding millenia. The
first discoverers of the New World were of Mongolian racial stock as are
the American Indians. They crossed from Siberia to Alaska over an
existing land bridge, over ice, or possibly by wading or by boat over the
shallow sea in the wake of mammoth, mastodon or musk ox herds on
whose flesh they lived. Following in the path of the huge animals, they
made their way possibly up the Yukon from its mouth to the divide,
thence down into the Mackenzie Basin, and along a great river where
now exist a chain of lakes and so into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> Valley.</p>
<p>The migrants trailing each herd doubtless traveled in their several
ways in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Family">family</a> groups, uniting from time to time to trap and kill one
of the great shaggy beasts. When the animals stopped, the families
bedded down nearby in the most sheltered spots available taking care
not to lose touch with the herd. These were wanderers, not explorers,
nor were they seeking new homes; they were hunters that traveled
where the herd led.</p>

<p>Their belongings, by our standards, were pitifully few, their way of
life laborious, full of hardship and danger, but their needs were simple
and their means of meeting them doubtless seemed ample to these
hardy hunters. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a> weapon was a thrusting spear with a chipped
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a> head and a long shaft to keep the hunter as far from harm&rsquo;s way as
possible when attacking the dangerous animal. The narrow width of the
spearpoint made it easy to withdraw from a wound and attack again.
Our evidence that the Paleo-Indians (as the Big Game Hunters are
commonly called) lived in Illinois are these same <a class="gloss" href="#g_Spearheads">spearheads</a> (<a class="gloss" href="#g_Clovis">Clovis</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Folsom">Folsom</a> types), usually grooved or fluted lengthwise of the blade,
which are scattered over much of the Illinois prairie as isolated finds.
No campsites of this <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> have yet been discovered in Illinois, as they
have been in Pennsylvania, Alabama and several southwestern states.
We can only surmise that in Illinois the hunters also had <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> hammers
and chipped flint scrapers as they had elsewhere.</p>
<p>Having arrived in the great central valley between the Rocky Mountains
and the eastern ranges, the herds probably moved slowly from one
browsing ground to another in the open corridor between glaciers. It
may have taken them many years to reach what is now the United
States. Eventually the herds wandered back and forth across the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>
Valley, and some favorable spots came to be used as camping
grounds again and again by the same or different families. Such places
would appeal immediately to the campers because of their protection
from rain and the piercing glacial winds, the presence of a plentiful
supply of wood and water. The possibility of our gaining a better
knowledge of Paleo-Indian life in Illinois rests on the discovery of such
a site, difficult now to recognize because it may no longer provide wood,
water, or shelter of any sort.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_12">12</div>
<p>There are in southern Illinois a number of simple linear <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> piles
known locally as &ldquo;stone forts,&rdquo; all in the same type of land structure.
Each forms an obstruction five to fifteen feet in height across a narrow
neck or ridge leading to the plateau top of a near-vertical-sided &ldquo;promontory&rdquo;
projecting out into a stream valley, making an excellent
corral, with no fence necessary except across the entrance. They may
have been used in late Paleo-Indian times and on into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> for impounding large game and/or driving them over the cliff.</p>
<h2 id="c3"><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">ARCHAIC</a> MAN, FIRST SETTLER IN ILLINOIS (8000 to 2500 B.C.)<a class="fn" id="fr_6" href="#fn_6">[6]</a></h2>
<p>We have reason to believe that the Big Game Hunters wandered
over Illinois and the adjoining states during the last advance of the
glaciers. Around 12,000 B.C. the climate in the Midwest became
milder, the glaciers &ldquo;retreated,&rdquo; and the mighty torrents&mdash;the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>,
the Ohio and the Illinois that had torn irresistibly down their
valleys&mdash;shrank into smaller, less turbulent rivers that occupied but a
fraction of their former beds. The great shaggy mammoths, musk oxen,
the ground sloths and the giant beavers moved westward toward the
mountains or to the north.</p>
<p>Some of the Big Game Hunters with their families may have followed
the retreating glacier and the herds; others stayed behind in
country to which they had grown attached. With the great herds gone,
the human families remaining in Illinois had to hunt the game animals
that now frequented the area&mdash;deer, elk (wapiti), bear and smaller mammals.
The large hunting party was no longer practicable. The game
roamed over the country singly or by twos or threes and had to be
stalked by one or two hunters. Families were compelled to live widely
separated one from another in order to secure ample food throughout
the year. Thus developed a new way of life which we call the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>.</p>
<p>The hunter, as time passed, learned the secret habits of the deer,
bear and raccoon and the more sluggish fishes. His wife and daughters
learned the haunts and ways of the smaller animals, the rodents, turtles
and lizards, discovered where edible greens, wild tubers, nuts and fruits
grew and where mussels and snails abounded in creeks and rivers. With
increasing knowledge <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> man made better and fuller use of his
changed and changing surroundings, food became more plentifully
available, life easier and less hazardous though still very difficult from
our standpoint.</p>

</div>
<p>With new needs and some leisure from the labor of providing
food, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> man invented specialized devices, new methods of making
tools and weapons, the more skillful among them shaping the objects
carefully into symmetrical forms pleasing to the eye of others and
strangely satisfying to the maker.<a class="fn" id="fr_7" href="#fn_7">[7]</a> He pecked a hollow in both sides of
his cobblestone hammer so he could grip it securely and use it more
skillfully. He pecked and ground diorite and granite into adzes, hatchets
(celts), and axes with a groove for hafting. These were a decided
improvement over flaked choppers. He ground and polished banded
and highly-colored shale (&ldquo;slate&rdquo;) into prismatic and cylindrical spearthrower
weights and bored them with a tube, sand and water. His own
person he decked out with necklaces and oval pendants (made by boring
a hole in smooth flat waterworn pebbles) and with bone ornaments
cut to shape, ground, engraved and polished. These he and his wife
wore as had their forefathers but not the skin robes of glacial times.</p>
<p>As life grew easier, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Family">family</a> or local group increased in size.
Sons brought their wives to the family dwelling place and built windbreaks
near those of their parents. With food abundant the little
settlement became a small cluster of households or a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hamlet">hamlet</a> consisting
possibly of sixty to seventy persons.</p>

the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Family">family</a> or local group, though they restricted themselves during most

advantage of the food resources of that locality. In winter perhaps they
moved to a <a class="gloss" href="#g_RockShelter">rock shelter</a>, like that of Modoc in Randolph County, Illinois,
near the wooded valleys of streams emptying into the river where
deer and elk sought protection from the rigors of winter; in spring to
upland lakes for duck and other waterfowl; and in autumn to wooded
<span class="pb" id="Page_15">15</span>
parklands to harvest acorns, hickory nuts, and berries. The spot chosen
for each hamlet location was generally one that had been so used at that
same season from time out of mind by the family and its forebears.</p>

</div>
<p>It is probable, as among most primitive peoples, that men did
only work thought
suitable to men, and
women that appropriate
for women. Men
made the weapons
and tools they used,
did the hunting and
fishing, and the fighting
(when quarrels developed
into feuds or
wars between local
groups of the same
tribe). The rest of the labor fell to the women&mdash;caring for the children,
collecting edible plants, clams and small animals, preparing the food,
and carrying burdens. All work was done by hand; loads were carried
on the back. It is possible that boats, perhaps of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dugout">dugout</a> type, were used
as among present-day <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> peoples living on waterways. There was
no other <a class="gloss" href="#g_Specialization">specialization</a> and each &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_Household">household</a>&rdquo; provided for the needs
of all its members to the best of its ability. No food was grown and no
domestic animal except the dog was known.</p>
<p>Once or twice a year when food was easily and bountifully available,
local groups from nearby hunting territories met together for
religious rites. These local groups spoke the same dialect, had the same
way of life, and considered themselves a unit or tribe. They had no
political form of government but were kept in order through habits
formed by early training and by extension of the kinship system to
the whole tribe. Thus the tribal elders were considered fathers and
mothers, and to them were due obedience and respect, just as children
they had been taught to regard their own blood fathers, uncles, and
other older relatives. The elders knew the tribal customs; and to be
accepted as a tribal member, boys must respect, learn and conform to
these customs.</p>
<p>The object of these annual gatherings was to teach the young
the tribal customs and to perform solemn ceremonies, the purpose of
which was to insure the security and well-being of the tribe, a continuing
abundance of the favorite foods, and to express gratitude and
thanksgiving to unseen Spirits who watched over the game animals
(and possibly the edible plants) for the blessings received during the
past year. These gatherings and cooperative undertakings served, on
the one hand, as a welcome change from the usual daily grind and
afforded opportunities for the young to get acquainted and choose
mates and, on the other, to unify the language and customs of the
constituent local groups, to enhance the influence of the tribal elders
and keep fresh in the minds of all the history of the tribe, the importance
of its activities, and its <a class="gloss" href="#g_SacredTradition">sacred tradition</a>, all essential to the
way of life of dynamic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> peoples of recent times.</p>

<p>In the later (Medial) <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> at Modoc, the dead were
buried in the floor of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_RockShelter">rock shelter</a>. Burial probably indicates
a belief in life after death. Care in preparing the body for burial,
in the funeral rites and burying, and in the customary mourning thereafter
was highly important so the dead man could go promptly to the
spirit world in peace and not remain in the neighborhood to disturb
his kinsmen. Immediately after the burial, it is probable that the little

in this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>.</p>

<span class="pb" id="Page_18">18</span>
daggers, bannerstones, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Spearthrower">spearthrower</a> with weight and more rarely copper
articles were placed alongside or on the corpse. In some instances large
stones were laid upon the grave probably for one or more of the following
reasons: (a) to mark the grave of an important tribesman; (b) to
keep the body from being disturbed by animals; and (c) to hold the
dead man&rsquo;s ghost until he departed for the spirit world.</p>

<h2 id="c4">CULTURES AND CULTURAL CHANGE</h2>
<p>Man can live virtually anywhere on the earth&rsquo;s surface where he
can obtain food, water and fuel, and do so without any fundamental
change in his physical structure. This is largely because he is easily
able to modify his customary ways of filling his basic needs under new
or changing conditions of his surroundings. For primitive man to &ldquo;live
better&rdquo; required an increasing knowledge of the resources in his locality
and ingenuity in devising effective means and contrivances for exploiting
them.</p>
<p>Because of this ability, the Paleo-Indian wanderers (Big Game
Hunters) in Illinois around 12,000 to 10,000 B.C., when confronted
with rising temperatures and other regional changes, could choose
whether they would follow the mammoth and musk ox herds and
familiar subglacial conditions elsewhere or adopt new and strange
methods of securing food and other requirements.</p>
<p>As Big Game Hunters they probably lived as a number of families
attached to a herd and relatively independent of each other except at
hunting times. They had no homes, only temporary camps, and were
bound to a moving herd, not to any particular region. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_PaleoIndian">Paleo-Indian</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> consisted of methods of trapping and slaying the great beasts
and of filling other simple physical needs; a simple code of social behavior
which enabled men and wives to live together with their children
and, for brief periods, in gatherings of the families in relative peace and
contentment; with religious beliefs and rites suitable to their cultural
level that they believed assured them of a continuance of their satisfactory
existence.</p>
<p>When the climate changed, those families that chose to remain in
Illinois had to develop, perhaps slowly and painfully, a new way of life.
The habits and haunts of deer, elk, bear and raccoon had to be learned.
Other methods of hunting and of making tools and devices to fit new
conditions were invented as a result of the new fund of knowledge
assembled. Each <a class="gloss" href="#g_Family">family</a> eventually acquired a more or less definite
piece of land or hunting territory in which it selected certain favorable
places to build the temporary <a class="gloss" href="#g_Hamlet">hamlet</a> at suitable seasons. As the man
and his family became better adapted to the land and its resources, he
hunted more successfully, and the family or local group grew larger
in number.</p>
<p>Probably a number of neighboring families, when food was especially
abundant, gathered together for social and religious purposes as
peoples living today in the same <a class="gloss" href="#g_Status">status</a> still do. Religious beliefs and
other customs had all this time doubtless been shifting gradually in
meeting the needs and dangers of changing conditions to a new way of
life we call the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>.</p>
<p>Every way of life is built on an older, often simpler, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> from
which it has changed more or less rapidly. Due to important inventions,
the group may modify its <a class="gloss" href="#g_Economy">economy</a> (ways of securing and processing
<span class="pb" id="Page_20">20</span>
food, etc.) and produce a substantially improved manner of living
which, from archaeological evidence alone, may be difficult to recognize
as a development from its earlier <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a>.</p>
<p>On occasion, <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> from another region may invade an area, drive
out the inhabitants and bring in a differing way of life. Usually this
merely extends, to a desirable region less effectively exploited by others,
the range of a vigorous cultural group whose territory has become too
densely populated.</p>
<p>Sometimes newcomers essay to live peaceably with the natives and
a new cultural blend is developed. If fundamental changes are made in
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Economy">economy</a> by internal development or by imitating another <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>,
social and religious customs are very likely to change too, though usually
at a slower pace.</p>
<p>As time went on, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> way of life slowly changed and finally
disappeared, but probably not so suddenly as might at first appear; for
many Archaic customs, tools, and weapons continued to be made and
used in the &ldquo;new&rdquo; <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> by the descendants of rugged earlier <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a>
or were adopted by newcomers to the region. Other changes were
added through new inventions and incoming people from other regions
producing a new culture now generally known as <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>.</p>
<h2 id="c5">THE INITIAL <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">WOODLAND</a> CULTURES<a class="fn" id="fr_9" href="#fn_9">[9]</a> (2500-500 B.C.)</h2>
<p>After 5000 B.C. the temperatures continued to rise producing a
climatic interval known as the <a class="gloss" href="#g_ThermalMaximum">Thermal Maximum</a> when it was warmer
and drier than at the present time. After reaching its high point, the
temperature gradually declined and probably ended in southern Illinois
about 2100 B.C. or later in a climate much like that of today.</p>
<p>By projecting the rate of deposit from the eight- to the eleven-foot
level of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_ModocRockShelter">Modoc Rock Shelter</a> up to the five-foot level where the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> remains appear to end, we secure a date for its upper limit of
about 2100 B.C. (Deuel 1957, p. 2). The remains between the five- and
eight-foot depths are scantier and less varied than in the earlier (lower)
layers and may indicate a cultural group in a losing struggle to maintain
itself under changing conditions.</p>

There, possibly as early as 2500 B.C., a new <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>, the Initial (early)
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>, was coming into existence. At any rate, groups living there
some time prior to 1000 B.C. made pottery, placed their dead in cemeteries

occasionally with food, personal ornaments and other funeral offerings.</p>

several resemblances did not travel from tribe to tribe from Asia to
central North America. The preservation of a pottery tradition during
a migration of 7000 miles, probably lasting for several generations,
seems equally incredible. Perhaps the most plausible explanation is
that two widely separated divisions of a people originating in central
Asia with the same cultural background and similar surroundings arrived
independently at a remarkably similar but very simple pottery type.</p>

small amount of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jewelry">jewelry</a> (shell and copper beads and pendants) and

cultural relatives lived south of the Ohio in Kentucky (Round Grave or
Upper Valley People). The Baumer <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> do not resemble those
of the Archaic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> very closely, giving one the impression that the
Baumer people developed their way of life elsewhere and moved into
Illinois, possibly while Archaic groups were still in the region.</p>
<p>The Baumer <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> differs in several ways from the northern
Initial <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>; actually it appears to be more advanced although it
has been termed early Woodland by some archaeologists. In the first
place, the area of settlement was more extensive which seems to indicate
a larger population than do early northern Woodland campsites. Their
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> are numerous and varied, suggesting they were well adapted
to their surroundings. Flat forms of polished <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> (resembling in outline
certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> bannerstones from which they may have derived)
served presumably as breast ornaments or gorgets (as similar pieces did
in the Hopewellian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>). Tear-shaped stone objects (plummets)
were made as they had been in Medial and Terminal Archaic. House
structures were semi-permanent, large, square, made of poles or logs
set in holes in the ground. Huts with circular floors seem to have been
in use also. Most important of the cultural habits noted were numerous
pits apparently for the storage of food. In these the remains of acorns
<span class="pb" id="Page_24">24</span>
and hickory nuts were found. These <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a>, like the acorn gatherers of
California and the Eskimo, knew how to preserve food over long periods.
Acorns were probably abundant enough for a Baumer <a class="gloss" href="#g_Family">family</a> to
lay up several months&rsquo; supply in a short time. This permitted them to
live in larger settlements and gave them sufficient leisure to build rather
substantial houses and shape symmetrical ornaments from stone. These
facts seem to substantiate the hypothesis that they were a sedentary
people by virtue of their knowledge of how to store food.</p>

<p>The size of the Baumer settlement, the semi-permanent houses, the
presence of chipped spades, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> pestles and pottery might lead one
to think that these <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> were plant-growers rather than simple food storers.
Comparing them with the acorn-gathering tribes of California,
who were storers and not food growers, it is seen that these, too, had
permanent settlements with well over one hundred inhabitants, rather
substantial houses, stone pestles, and some tribes, at least, had pottery
vessels. The Californians doubtless had digging tools since the rooms
of some houses were dug four feet down into the soil.</p>
<p>Traces of Hopewellian influence, possibly indicating inter-marriage
with Hopewellians, have been noted at the Sugar Camp Hill site (date
undetermined) in Jackson County, which is presumably later than
Baumer. However, the Baumerians like the native Californians were
conservative, for four centuries intervened between the oldest Hopewellian
village in the north and the earliest known station of that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>
in southern Illinois.<a class="fn" id="fr_11" href="#fn_11">[11]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_26">26</div>
<h2 id="c7">THE HOPEWELLIAN <a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">CIVILIZATION</a><a class="fn" id="fr_12" href="#fn_12">[12]</a> (500 B.C.-500 A.D.)</h2>
<p>Toward the end of the Initial <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> maize or corn, as
we call it today, was introduced into northern Illinois, presumably from
Mexico and Middle America through the agency of intervening tribes.
In an apparently short time, its production seems to have been greatly
intensified and exploited. Other food crops and tobacco may have
accompanied maize.</p>
<p>About the same time, a <a class="gloss" href="#g_FormalizedReligion">formalized religion</a> arose, probably concerned
with the worship of deities who personified natural forces like
the sun, rain and thunder, which were important to a plant-growing
<a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a>. From the evidence of burial places, there seem to have been
two or possibly three social classes. Doubtless the first comprised the
families who introduced and grew the new food plants and who were
inspired to invent the complex <a class="gloss" href="#g_Religion">religion</a>. The burial of the dead, especially
those socially important and of the highest class, was accompanied
by elaborate and colorful ceremonies closely bound to the religion. This
seems to be a continuation in grander form of the earlier Red Ochre
funeral and burial. It is unfortunate that we do not have tangible evidence
of their other religious and political ceremonies which may have
been even more impressive and significant. The official dress and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Insigne">insignia</a>
of the officials, which we can barely glimpse in the rich and
varied remains in the tombs, signify a political system of social control
and an established priesthood for the spiritual guidance of the community.
Shamans or medicine men probably had only the duty of
treating disease. Reverence for and possibly worship of ancestors is
suggested by the impressive tomb chambers and mounds and the care
obviously bestowed on certain of their socially prominent dead.</p>
<p>Social and political prestige, religious pomp and ceremonial, all
seem to have combined to stimulate a demand for rare materials, beautiful
jewels and impressive regalia. This initiated the search for pearls
at home, the development of skillful and artistic workmanship in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a>,
bone, shell, copper and mica, travel abroad and trade in materials
obtainable only in distant regions.</p>
<p>Aside from those technologies connected with the growing of plant foods,
probably few new crafts appeared in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>; rather those
<span class="pb" id="Page_27">27</span>
already, existing in the Initial <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> were raised to a high degree
of excellence. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">Art</a> in several forms flourished&mdash;carving in the round
and in relief, the making of fine symmetrical polished, decorated and
painted pottery commonly called typical Hopewellian, hammered copper
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Jewelry">jewelry</a>, the setting of pearls and highly-colored native stones as
eyes in sculptured animals and in bear-tooth pendants and ear ornaments,
etching of delicate designs, naturalistic and conventional, on
bone and the modeling and firing of exquisite statuettes in clay. We
admire and wonder at the excellence of execution in the best of their
small sculpture because they are skillfully fashioned and finished and
because they so accurately portray the characteristics and habits of
animals with which we are familiar. The artist had the crudest of tools
to aid him&mdash;<a class="gloss" href="#g_RoughStone">rough stone</a> hammers and an anvil for <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pecking">pecking</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> to
the general form; sandstone files or abraders; clay and water to polish
pieces; <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a> and tubular drills for boring; and flint knives to cut and
engrave pottery and bone&mdash;in spite of which the best craftsmen well
knew how to bring out the beauty of the piece.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_28">28</div>
<p>For the first time in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Amerindian">Amerindian</a> history in Illinois we become
aware of an accumulation of wealth, a surplus of handmade goods over
and above those needed for survival; many of these were neither well-suited
nor intended for immediate physical needs, but rather were
aimed at social display or spiritual enhancement. Wealth reflects a
relatively constant and abundant supply of food and other necessities
and the resulting accompaniment of considerable leisure time for a
sizable portion of the community. It may also mark the beginning of
craft <a class="gloss" href="#g_Specialization">specialization</a>.<a class="fn" id="fr_13" href="#fn_13">[13]</a></p>
<p>It is hardly necessary to add that, if such a profusion of grave offerings
as indicated by Hopewellian tombs&mdash;<a class="gloss" href="#g_FeatherCloth">feather cloth</a> robes, pearl
necklaces, copper hatchets, and beautifully fashioned <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">art</a> objects&mdash;were
left with the dead, that the high political and religious officers were
correspondingly bedecked in gorgeous apparel for civil and religious
ceremonies.</p>
<p>Nor should sight be lost of the fact that these creations and materials,
so commonplace and inexpensive today, were to the Hopewellians
as valuable and highly desirable as gold, silk, and precious stones
are to us in Western <a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">civilization</a>. For a better perspective these tomb
offerings should be compared with objects usually found in camp and
grave sites of the Initial and Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> peoples.</p>
<p>Traders may have gone to distant regions to select and barter for
raw materials, to the Lake Superior region for copper, to Ohio for pipestone,
to the south Atlantic and Gulf Coasts for the small Marginella
and Oliva <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shells">shells</a>, for the larger Cassis and Busycon shells, and to the
Yellowstone or Mexico for <a class="gloss" href="#g_Obsidian">obsidian</a> (of which little is found in Illinois
graves). Trade, to some degree, removes the limitations imposed by the
immediate surroundings. Pearls were secured in quantity from the
clams of the native streams. Bone, antler, tortoise and clam shell, bears&rsquo;
teeth, bear, wildcat and wolverine jaws from their hunting and collecting
pursuits were utilized more fully than ever before. Even human
jaws, possibly of enemies, were cut, polished and bored for use as pendants.</p>
<p>Though the Hopewellians may not have been the pacifists they are
sometimes painted, there must have been long periods of peaceful
relationships with distant and nearer neighbors with whom they
traded or through whose territories their traders had to pass. Whether
or not a condition of peace was maintained within the borders of their
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> area by the force of arms is an interesting question that cannot
now be answered.</p>

</div>
<div class="pb" id="Page_30">30</div>
<p>In southern Illinois the advance of Hopewellian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> was slower.
The infiltration of new pottery styles noted at <a class="gloss" href="#g_CrabOrchard">Crab Orchard</a> very possibly
represents intermarriage with Hopewellian women. Possibly
through ties of relationship and the acceptance of the new food plants,
the old Baumer way of life was submerged by the Hopewellian customs
though here and there former habits still are recognizable. Some customs
of Baumer and Crab Orchard were adopted by the northern Hopewellians&mdash;the
reel-shaped <a class="gloss" href="#g_Gorget">gorget</a>, the plummet and the chipped <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a>
hoe.</p>
<p>In the north of Illinois, Hopewellian lasted until 250 A.D. (Poole
site) and in the west and south to about 450 or 500 A.D. Though the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> died out in Illinois by 500 A.D., it still flourished in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>
(Bynum site) around 800 A.D. and at Marksville, Louisiana, as late as
850 A.D.</p>
<p>As was stated earlier, emerging cultures grow out of earlier ones.
Although it may not yet be generally recognized, the Hopewellian
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">civilization</a> probably exerted tremendous influence on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>
cultures and on tribes that followed them in the great central valley of
the United States and beyond, down to historic times. It must be
borne in mind that in spite of their splendid achievements, the Hopewellians
had no domestic animals but the dog, no herds for meat and
great wealth, no draft animals to drag the plough and turn the mill. All
labor was &ldquo;by hand,&rdquo; all transport on the back or in a boat driven by
human power.</p>
<h2 id="c8">THE DARK AGE IN ILLINOIS&mdash;FINAL <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">WOODLAND</a> (200 to 900 A.D.)</h2>
<p>The Hopewellian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">civilization</a> apparently disappeared as suddenly
as it seems to have arisen. This impression is probably due to the fact
that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> continued to live in the old villages long after the
characteristic colorful Hopewell customs were no longer practiced.
Actually the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> may have declined for a century or more before it
finally broke down completely. Many of the simpler folk traditions
probably persisted in the area for some centuries afterward.</p>
<p>Possibly long continued abuses of power and privilege by religious
and political officials, especially those from the highest social caste,
weakened the confidence of the lower classes in their leaders and the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>. Newcomers from Iowa, Missouri and Kentucky may have
further disorganized certain settlements and separated areas of the
larger community from each other. Generally, however, the writer
gets the impression that the decay began within the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">civilization</a> although
its final downfall may have been accelerated by external pressures.</p>
<p>With failing confidence and a rising uneasiness, trade would naturally
decrease and the incentive to fine workmanship decline. The
larger cultural community split apart into a number of small tribes,
who were isolationists and individualists. All the separate little tribal
units were <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> culturally with some small evidence of their
Hopewellian heritage, but each differed in certain respects from its
<span class="pb" id="Page_31">31</span>
neighbors. Villages dwindled to the mere hamlets, widely separated one
from another. The elaborate ceremonial dress, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Insigne">insignia</a>, and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jewelry">jewelry</a>,
and the artistic creations (at least in durable materials) became a part
of the past; the <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> found themselves reduced to the rude cultural
level of their early Woodland ancestors. Huts were flimsy and left no
discernible remains. Tools, weapons, and ornaments were, in general,
carelessly made and poorly finished. Although tobacco was smoked and
small patches of maize and beans may have been grown, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a>
economic dependence undoubtedly was on hunting, fishing and collecting.</p>

</div>
<p>The religious beliefs, too, were probably simplified and mixed with
magic and superstition, surviving relics of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Religion">religion</a> of the past age.
In a word, the social and religious customs of the little tribes were
broadly similar but in minor details differed from each other much as
do their artifactual remains.</p>
<p>A study of the Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> and other phases of Illinois history
reveals certain relationships among some distinguishable differences of
detail:</p>
<p>1. The almost complete lack of evidence of Hopewellian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">art</a>, trade
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Religion">religion</a> in the late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> gives little apparent indication
that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> were the direct descendants and heirs of that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">civilization</a>.
<span class="pb" id="Page_32">32</span>
On the other hand, the general resemblance of Final Woodland assemblages
to those of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_InitialPhase">Initial phase</a> seems marked. Let us examine
further.</p>
<div class="img" id="fig20">

</div>
<p>The tobacco pipe of the late <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a> with the stem projecting beyond
the bowl is found in most aspects. Likewise, the vertically elongated
pot is common but not the only form. Burials are often in mounds,
frequently in a central chamber or grave, with skeletons in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flexed">flexed</a>
and/or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Extended">extended</a> positions, occasionally accompanied by grave offerings.
All these are broadly reminiscent of Hopewellian customs and, in the
writer&rsquo;s opinion, indicate a continuing thread of tradition from Initial <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> through
Hopewellian into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_FinalPhase">Final phase</a>.</p>
<p>2. The relationship to the Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> seems more evident
and has been attributed by some authors to the &ldquo;impact&rdquo; of a high
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> on that of cruder or &ldquo;under-developed&rdquo; neighbors. What are
the grounds for these conclusions?</p>
<p>New pottery forms were being attempted, the flattened globular
pot, the shallow bowl (occasionally found in Hopewellian sites), the
cup or beaker and the plate. In southern counties, a new method of
making pits is indicated by a tendency of sherds, even grit-tempered
ones, to split or laminate (see Maxwell, <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> Cultures of Southern
Illinois</i>, Beloit, 1951, p. 204). Secondary features previously lacking
begin to appear as &ldquo;raised points&rdquo; or knobs on rims, some roughly resembling
animal heads with ears and a snout. Triangular <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arrowheads">arrowheads</a>
and others reflecting larger spearhead types are all made from curved,
not flat flakes as the Mississippian points are. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> discoidal that
seems to be the game piece of the historically known chunkey game,
which was possibly initiated in late Hopewellian times (see Fowler, <i>The
Rutherford <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mound">Mound</a></i>, Springfield, 1957, pp. 31-33) occurs in the Bluff
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> and probably in the Tampico also.</p>

</div>
<p>All these bespeak Middle Mississippian tendencies. A common
conclusion, as mentioned previously, is that these features were borrowed
from non-Woodland groups. The writer, however, gets the impression
from his studies that the Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a> developed
through the interplay of invention and adoption of improvements,
modification and re-invention, between the Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> subcultures
in Illinois and adjacent territory. This does not mean that
Illinois communities alone were responsible for the emergence of this
phase but rather that they played an important dynamic role in its
development. The Cahokia <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> of western and central Illinois
probably constituted the native local tribe or nation.</p>
<h3>Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">Archaeology</a></h3>
<p>Archaeologically these peoples are in the Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a>
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>. The <a class="gloss" href="#g_FinalPhase">Final Phase</a> yields tobacco pipes and crude <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arrowheads">arrowheads</a>,
its <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a> artifactual differences with the Initial phase. The clay
of their pottery was generally mixed with grit or sand to prevent firing
cracks in the vessel walls. The customary vertically-elongated pot with
a conical or pointed bottom was accompanied by new forms&mdash;the
globular or flattened globular with &ldquo;round&rdquo; (spherical) bases, the
&ldquo;coconut shell&rdquo; cup or larger vessel, and shallow bowls. The flattened
globular pots and the bowls were occasionally decorated with two or
<span class="pb" id="Page_34">34</span>
four knobs or with &ldquo;raised points&rdquo; on the rim, sometimes giving a
squarish appearance to the mouth. In some instances these decorative
projections were crudely modeled ears and snout which give the effect
of animals&rsquo; heads facing out and foreshadowing the Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Effigy">effigy</a> shallow bowls. An important invention, the bow and arrow,
appears in Illinois for the first time in this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>. Judging by the
crudity of the chipped flint arrowheads, these <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> were poor archers
and preferred the spear and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Spearthrower">spearthrower</a> in hunting and fighting. Pipes,
like most <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> except weapon heads, are rare. The &ldquo;elbow&rdquo; or
L-shaped pipe is generally representative of the culture.</p>
<p>The six recognized Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> subcultures with their diagnostic
(though not very significant) traits are (1) <a class="gloss" href="#g_EffigyMound">Effigy Mound</a> named
for its distinguishing characteristic; (2) Tampico with pottery decorated
with designs formed by cord-impressions, in northern Illinois; (3) <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">Stone</a>
Vault with stone mounds containing walled tomb chambers; (4) Jersey
Bluff with its unique &ldquo;handled&rdquo; tobacco pipes, in the west; (5) Raymond,
best characterized by the generalized Woodland nature of its

<h2 id="c9">A SECOND PLANT-RAISING <a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">CIVILIZATION</a>&mdash;THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPIANS (1000-1500 A.D.)</h2>
<p>The Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> seems to have arisen, as previously
suggested, in the area where several important highways of aboriginal
travel converged&mdash;the region surrounding the Ohio and Mississippi
rivers from the mouth of the Wabash to the mouth of the Illinois.
Whether or not its development was stimulated by the contracts of
Muskhogeans and Algonkians or whether it was due to interplay between
the cultures of the Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> petty tribes is unknown.</p>
<p>Two slightly differing subcultures of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_MiddlePhase">Middle phase</a> appeared in
the state. One, known archaeologically as the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cumberland">Cumberland</a> (Tennessee-Cumberland),
may have embraced at one time all the southern Illinois
counties between the mouths of the Kaskaskia and the Wabash. [The
Angel Site near Evansville, Indiana, may belong to the Cumberland
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a>.] The other subculture, which may be termed Cahokia,
flourished in counties bordering on the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> from Union County
to Wisconsin. As the two periods show few significant cultural differences,
they will, except as noted hereafter, be treated as a single
unit.</p>
<p>The bow and arrow invented in the Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a>, was
developed early in the Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> into an effective
weapon although spear and perhaps <a class="gloss" href="#g_Spearthrower">spearthrower</a> continued in use.
The chunkey game was probably played as a part of a religious ceremony
though it may quite possibly have served as a popular pastime as well.</p>
<p>Pottery was slow at first to change from its more obvious <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>
characteristics but new shapes foreshadowing most of those of the fully
<span class="pb" id="Page_35">35</span>
developed (Old Village) cultural <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a> practically replaced the conical-based
elongated pot early in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>. Cord-roughening and grit-tempering
disappeared in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Classic">classic</a> Cahokia period, and a fine polished
blackware and a painted pottery were added to the smooth utilitarian
ware. An excellent &ldquo;dull gray&rdquo; ware with smooth gray to brown surfaces
was of more common occurrence. It appears to differ from the fine
ware only in its partially oxidized surfaces probably due to poorly controlled
firing methods.<a class="fn" id="fr_14" href="#fn_14">[14]</a></p>

</div>
<p>There were probably two or more social classes among the <a class="gloss" href="#g_MiddlePhase">Middle phase</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> as
there were among Hopewellians, Natchez and Polynesians.<a class="fn" id="fr_15" href="#fn_15">[15]</a>
The fine polished black and painted wares may have been
<span class="pb" id="Page_36">36</span>
marks of distinction between the highest and lower classes since it is
much less common. In Hopewellian times, it is probable that both
the fine ware and the specialized forms (which were usually of the
highest quality) were reserved for the highest caste. In the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>, the shallow bowl, the cup or beaker, and the plate of dull gray
ware seem to have been wide-spread in the village and may indicate
a general improvement of living conditions among the lower social classes since Hopewellian times.</p>

</div>
<p>Advances in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Economy">economy</a> were obviously present in the fully developed
<a class="gloss" href="#g_MiddlePhase">Middle phase</a>. The Union County <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a> &ldquo;mines&rdquo; and workshops
were intensively worked. Trade with the Lake Superior, lower
Atlantic and Gulf Coast regions was resumed. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">Chief</a> imports of raw
materials were copper and marine <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shells">shells</a>, Busycon, Marginella, Oliva
and Olivella. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">Art</a>, while possibly as highly developed as Hopewellian,
resulted in a far smaller number of art objects in fewer durable media.
Intaglio rock carvings (chiefly in southern Illinois) of geometric designs,
human hands, ceremonial paraphernalia, animal outlines, and, in a few
instances, painted hollowed-out animal silhouettes can probably be
ascribed to this <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> on the basis of the symbols employed. Dwellings
or cabins were relatively substantial structures and the extent of village
remains indicate a large general population as compared to earlier times
in the state. Trade and art suggest leisure and wealth or surplus available
for exchange or to support officials and others in non-food productive
<span class="pb" id="Page_37">37</span>
pursuits. This prosperity was possibly due to newly discovered
methods of intensive cultivation of maize and possibly to a greater
diversity of crops than ever before.</p>

</div>
<p>Territorially the tribe probably consisted of a number of villages
and the surrounding country. Each tribe may have had a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a> village
or capital that was also a religious center with tribal (public) buildings
and a temple. Archaeological and historical evidence shows that these
buildings, presumably temples and the dwellings of tribal chiefs and
the high priests, were erected on the flat tops of rectangular earthen
mounds or pyramids, which were grouped around a plaza of ceremonial
square. Here the tribe gathered for religious and political ceremonies
and for important funerals. Intertribal negotiations and chunkey games
were probably also staged on or near the plaza.</p>
<p>Pipes, either of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> or pottery, were generally of the &ldquo;equal-armed&rdquo;
type (where stem length is about equal to bowl height). In
numerous instances, a short projection resembling the stem in shape
but shorter, extends beyond the bowl away from the smoker. Massive
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Effigy">effigy</a> pipes of stone were widespread but not numerous. Some were
excellently carved. From their construction, it is obvious that they were
made to be smoked through a reed or hollow wooden stem called in
later times the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calumet">calumet</a>. These together probably constituted a form
of ceremonial pipe that served as a safe conduct between tribes, as a
bond and signature at peace- and treaty-making ceremonies, and to
present tobacco smoke as incense to the gods in religious rituals.</p>
<p>Priests and possibly tribal chiefs were interred in the flat tops of
mounds (e.g. the Powell <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mound">Mound</a>) near temple or cabin. Generally,
however, the dead were buried in cemeteries. In some instances, bodies
were laid on the surface above a &ldquo;full&rdquo; cemetery and covered with earth
brought from outside. Continuing this practice eventually produced
a mound (e.g. <a class="gloss" href="#g_DicksonMound">Dickson Mound</a> near Lewistown). Possibly the burial mounds at
Cahokia were reserved for the socially prominent while the
<span class="pb" id="Page_38">38</span>
lower classes were interred in the cemeteries nearby. The dead, especially
important personages were attired in their finest apparel, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Insigne">insignia</a>
and personal ornaments. Beside them in the grave were placed their
weapons, favorite chunkey stones, food and water in pottery vessels
with shell spoons or a dipper.</p>

<p><a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">Chief</a> villages were large religious centers often protected by an
encircling palisade or clay wall reinforced with vertical posts or logs.
Remains of defensive walls can still be readily traced by a trained eye
at the Kincaid (Massac County) and Lynn (Union County) villages.
Exploration of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Aztalan">Aztalan</a> village (Wisconsin) yielded remains of
a reinforced clay wall surmounted at regular intervals with towers
of like construction. The Cahokia village seems to have been without
fortifications.</p>

near Metropolis, Illinois. (Diorama by Arthur Sieving.)</p>
</div>
<p>Smaller villages occasionally had one or two small flat-topped
mounds which doubtless served as bases for the cabins of the Village
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">Chief</a> and possibly <a class="gloss" href="#g_War">War</a> Chief. Other <a class="gloss" href="#g_MiddlePhase">Middle phase</a> villages had no
mounds or fortifications.</p>
<p>Cabins were of three or more types. In Illinois, two kinds had
rectangular floor outlines and may have developed from the earlier
Baumer square dwelling and the Lewis house. One of these types prevalent
at Kincaid, as determined from charred remains, had a thatched
gable roof supported on four corner posts with their lower ends sunk in
the ground. Walls were made of clay daubed on a latticework of cane
(with foliage) interlacing vertical wall posts, the interior covered with
split cane mats. The rafters, corner and wall posts, and wall plates were
of poles or small logs lashed together and held in place by braided
ropes. Floors do not appear to have been depressed below surrounding
ground level. A larger more substantial structure, presumably a temple,
on a Kincaid <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mound">mound</a> (Mx<sup>o</sup>9) had thick walls of clay mixed with grass,
but otherwise resembled the dwelling just described. The clay floor and
wall surfaces were smooth. Fire basins of puddled clay within the building
may have been the remains of altars.</p>
<p>Cabins in Fulton County (Fout&rsquo;s Village) and at Cahokia were
rectangular in floor plan but wall posts were probably bent over to be
joined with corresponding opposite members to form an arched or
vaulted roof, the precursor perhaps of the &ldquo;barrel-shaped&rdquo; Illini cabins
<span class="pb" id="Page_40">40</span>
reported by French explorers. Floors were sunk somewhat below the
ground level. Remains of cabins with circular floors occur also at
Cahokia and in Fulton County.</p>

<p>Walls and wall posts of the Fulton County cabins appear in some
instances to be formed of bundles of small branches or cane set in
trenches possibly a foot deep. There is no evidence of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_WattleAndDaub">wattle-and-daub</a>
structure. Walls may have been covered with mats, or with rectangles
of bark. Roofs were probably thatched.</p>
<p>Possibly the Cahokia <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> peoples constituted a single tribe,
a small nation, or a confederation of tribes. At its most powerful <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>,
the Cahokia settlement was perhaps the capital and religious center.
The region south of a line joining the mouths of the Kaskaskia and
Wabash rivers at one time probably belonged to another tribe or subtribe
whose <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a> village was the <a class="gloss" href="#g_KincaidCommunity">Kincaid community</a> in Pope and Massac
counties and who, linguistically and culturally, were closely related
to peoples in Tennessee and Kentucky and at the Angel site in Indiana.</p>
<p>Archaeologically speaking, the Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> contrasts sharply
with the Hopewellian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>. Certain <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> are readily distinguishable
and easily identified with the craftsman&rsquo;s cultures. Actually the
Mississippians differ from the Hopewellians chiefly in having substantial
cabins, athletic games and the bow and arrow.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_41">41</div>
<p>Remains of Hopewellian dwellings are rare, but the three or four
found up to now are characterized by round or oval floor plans outlined
with post holes of three to four inches in diameter. These seem to indicate
hemispherical wigwams. No further evidence of wall or roof
structure has been recovered. The rarity of these dwellings certainly
suggests a less permanent dwelling than the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> cabin. However,
it will be remembered that some peoples <a class="gloss" href="#g_Pattern">pattern</a> their tombs
upon their dwellings. The upper caste Hopewellians built rectangular
burial chambers which were walled up with logs laid one on another
and roofed over with half-logs or bark. Similar log house surface structures
would seldom leave discernible remains on decay. It is possible,
though by no means certain, that the Hopewellians of highest caste, and
perhaps of the other castes, built log cabins for dwellings.</p>
<p>The evidence for playing of athletic games in Hopewellian is very
late and scanty. The only tangible indication are the rings, &ldquo;pulleys&rdquo;
and a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> discoidal found with a skeleton in the Rutherford <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mound">Mound</a>.
(See M. L. Fowler, <i>The Rutherford Mound</i>, Scientific Papers Series,
Vol. VII, No. 1, Springfield, Ill. 1957, pp. 31-33). The rings of pottery
and of cannel coal (or jet) seem too fragile for actual playing pieces and
may rather be trophies or prizes, replicas of similar pieces made of wood.
Such wooden pieces may have been used in games throughout middle and late Hopewellian times.</p>

<p>The bow and arrow, at least, seems to be a decided improvement
over the spear. It constituted a repeating weapon. Ammunition could
be carried in the belt or on the back in a quiver without unduly hampering
the bowman. On the other hand, it was useless in hand-to-hand
fighting and a spear or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dagger">dagger</a> was needed to supplement it. Moreover,
the spear with a thrower was a more accurate weapon than the bow, unless
the arrows were carefully made and balanced. The bow never
<span class="pb" id="Page_42">42</span>
seems to have wholly replaced the spear which continued to be a
favorite weapon down into the European contact <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>.</p>
<p>The improvements that distinguish the Mississippians above the
Hopewellians may be more apparent than real in the first two instances
and, in the third, may represent a significant rather than a fundamental
advance. Looking at the two periods from the broader cultural viewpoint,
they appear to have many cultural features in common. The
Middle Mississippians probably added new food and fibre plants to
those of earlier periods, and perhaps increased production by improved,
more intensive methods of cultivation. Their staple crops like those of
the Hopewellians were corn, beans and tobacco.</p>
<p>The technologies or methods of making the necessary tools in the
two cultures varied but little. <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">Art</a> was revived or rather re-developed in
the Mississippian <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> but fewer media are employed. In artistic
skill, imagination and productiveness perhaps the Hopewellians had
an edge on the later <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a>.</p>
<p>Trade and travel, though resumed to distant sections of the continent,
does not appear so widespread or general as in the Hopewellian
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>. A <a class="gloss" href="#g_FormalizedReligion">formalized religion</a> with colorful ceremonies seems to have
revitalized the life of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> but possibly no more effectively than
in the earlier period.</p>
<p>There was no significant improvement in labor, power or transportation;
all were still accomplished wholly by human effort without
the aid of draft animals. Traveling by boat was known and probably
used by both cultures.</p>
<p>Comparing the two peoples with other plant growers having no
domestic food-draft animals, it seems apparent that each had an effective
<a class="gloss" href="#g_PoliticalOrganization">political organization</a>, a formalized vital <a class="gloss" href="#g_Religion">religion</a> with true priests
(not &ldquo;self-appointed&rdquo; shamans) and a system of moral values and
tenets that &ldquo;church&rdquo; and &ldquo;state&rdquo; were organized to maintain. All in all,
from the broader cultural standpoint, they were amazingly alike.</p>
<h2 id="c10">UNDER-DEVELOPED NEIGHBORS&mdash;THE UPPER MISSISSIPPIANS (1100?-1600 A.D.)</h2>
<p>Less advanced <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> tribes with customs showing some admixture
of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> cultural elements living contemporaneously in
Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin, Indiana and Ohio, encircled the <a class="gloss" href="#g_MiddlePhase">Middle phase</a> peoples
on the east, north and west. Known generally now as
the Upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a> peoples their sole representative in Illinois was the
<a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> of the Langford <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a>, who dwelt around the southern end
of Lake Michigan as well as in adjacent parts of Indiana and Michigan.
The <a class="gloss" href="#g_TypeStation">type station</a> is the Fisher Village and Mounds near Joliet which
were ably investigated by Mr. George Langford, Sr. some years ago.<a class="fn" id="fr_16" href="#fn_16">[16]</a></p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_43">43</div>
<p>They built no flat-topped pyramids and left little, if any, evidence
of their religious practices. Their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">art</a>, as exhibited by pottery, personal
ornaments or weapons was not of a high order. There is no evidence
that they played the chunkey game. Some copper hatchets and ornaments
were in use, but these appear to be of Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> workmanship
and may have been trade articles.</p>
<p>On the positive side, they buried their dead in dome-shaped
earthen mounds, usually in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Extended">extended</a> position, frequently with
food (in clay pots with shell spoons), weapons (arrows and tomahawks
or hafted celts), personal ornaments and various utilitarian implements.
Dwellings had subsurface circular floors and were doubtless dome-shaped
(hemispherical). The bow and arrow were in common use with
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Arrowheads">arrowheads</a> primarily of slender simple triangular shape, very rarely with
side notches. Implements, weapons and ornaments were chiefly of
chipped <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a>, ground or polished <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a>, river clam <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shells">shells</a>, bone and
animal teeth. Copper was rarely employed.</p>

<p>Pots were generally of the globular or flattened globular shape
(olla or jar), tempered with grit (early) and shell (later), and decorated
with geometric designs in broad lines and dots, drawn (&ldquo;trailed&rdquo;)
or impressed on the shoulder region with a blunt tool (such as an
antler tine). Lips of vessels were usually pressure-notched and surfaces
cord-roughened. Loop handles on the jars were common.</p>
<p>Numerous examples of flat <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> tablets associated with a number
of short solid antler cylinders lead one to suspect that a game of chance
of some sort was played and that gambling was probably indulged in.</p>
<p>Other than pottery and personal adornment, the only <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">art</a> practiced
was the cutting of mussel shell into handled spoons and outlines of fish
and other objects. Apparently there was no urge for fine workmanship.</p>
<p>It is highly probable that these Upper Mississippians were plant growers who
hunted to secure their meat. The extent of village remains
and the evidence of semi-permanent dwellings point to this type of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Economy">economy</a> even
though no grain or seeds of any kind were found in
<span class="pb" id="Page_44">44</span>

<p>Apparently most of their needs were supplied by their own efforts
and from local sources. There is no evidence of any trade, except possibly
of a very limited kind with near neighbors to the west.</p>
<p>The evidence for the residence around the southern lake shores is
based chiefly on the occurrence of the Fisher pottery type. This area
after 1760 was occupied by the Miami tribe who may possibly have
been the builders of the Fisher Mounds.</p>

<h2 id="c11">THE ILLINOIS OR ILLINI<a class="fn" id="fr_17" href="#fn_17">[17]</a> (1550?-1833 A.D.)</h2>
<p>The Illinois or Illini Indians are, so far as is now known, the next
group to occupy the state following the Middle Mississippians. At the
time of Marquette and Jolliet&rsquo;s voyage in 1673, six tribes comprised
the Illinois Confederacy, Kaskaskia, Cahokia, Michigamea, Peoria,
Moingwena, and Tamaroa<a class="fn" id="fr_18" href="#fn_18">[18]</a>. The tribes spoke the same or mutually
intelligible dialects of the Algonkian language.</p>
<p>Some time before 1650, possibly a century or more, the Illinois
Confederacy seems to have been a powerful nation but in the latter
half of the 17th century this was a tradition rather than fact. The
Confederacy appears to have engaged in no united action after 1650.</p>
<p>The Illini at that time were in the plant-raising <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>
and possessed only the dog as a domesticated animal. Like many other
plant-raisers, the families deserted the village for the hunt after the
corn was hilled and again after the harvest.</p>
<h3>Dress</h3>
<p>Men went naked in summer except for mocassins. At times a
<a class="gloss" href="#g_BreechCloth">breech cloth</a> was worn; in winter buffalo skin robes were added and
belts, leg bands and leggings on occasion.</p>
<p>Women when working apparently wore only a girdle (<a class="gloss" href="#g_BreechCloth">breech cloth</a>),
at other times a wrap-around skirt of skin with a belt passing
over one shoulder and under the opposite arm. The skirt dates back
to Hopewellian times and was used during the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> in
Indiana and probably in Illinois. The bosom was covered with a deerskin
wrap. Hair was worn long and fastened behind the head.</p>
<h3><a class="gloss" href="#g_Economy">Economy</a></h3>
<p>Labor was divided between the men and the women (and children).
Men did the hunting, fighting and made the weapons. The women
(and children) did the other work&mdash;the housework, planting and harvesting
the crops, dressing deer and buffalo skins, making twine from <a class="gloss" href="#g_Bast">bast</a>,
weaving cloth and, on the hunt, carrying the house parts and setting
up the camp.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_46">46</div>
<p>Buffalo meat was preserved by drying and smoking it over a fire in
the hunting camp. Vegetable foods, corn, beans and squash were dried
or parched and buried in containers or in lined pits in the ground and
covered over. Watermelons, muskmelons (?), gourds and tobacco were
also grown. Wild strawberries, paw paws, pecans, lotus roots, wild
tubers, grapes and plums formed part of their diet.</p>
<p>The winter buffalo hunt usually took place a long way from the
village. The hunting units each consisted of several families under a
rigid police system and regulation to prevent the herd from being
stampeded by an over-eager <a class="gloss" href="#g_Family">family</a> before all were amply provided with
meat. Violations of hunting regulations were punished by destruction
of the offender&rsquo;s property to which no resistance was ever attempted.
The group surrounded the herd, at times encircling it with fires made at
intervals near which the hunters stood and killed the stampeding animals.
At times as many as 120 buffalo were killed in a day. The women
cut out the tongues, skinned the animals, and, peeling off the sides of
meat, dried and smoked them on wooden grates over a slow fire. The
smoked sides were carried back to the village on the back, or when
practicable in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dugout">dugout</a> boats. Carcasses and bones were left on the
hunting grounds. Other animals were stalked by one or two hunters.
Dog meat was considered a great delicacy.</p>
<p>Fish were caught in nets, by hook and line, speared or shot with
bow and arrow. They were dried for preservation. Maple trees were
tapped late in the winter, the sap caught in bark containers and made
into a maple drink or reduced by boiling to syrup and sugar. Corn was
ground into meal and baked into bread, or prepared as hominy.</p>
<p>Vessels and utensils were made of wood or clay, ladles from a
section of the buffalo skull. Fire was produced by the hand drill in
the usual manner.</p>
<p>The cabin type seems to have varied at different periods or in
different tribes. In early times, cabins had rectangular floors and vaulted
(barrel-shaped) roofs. They were roofed and floored with &ldquo;double-mats&rdquo;
of flat rushes and were impervious to wind or rain. Occasionally
they were erected on low mounds (two feet high) to keep the floors
dry. Large cabins of the vaulted type had four fires, with one or two
families at a fire.</p>
<p>Bark-covered hemispherical huts or wigwams may have been used
on hunting trips. They were apparently common in some villages in
1723.</p>
<p>Overland travel was on foot. On streams the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Dugout">dugout</a> boat was
propelled by pole and possibly by paddle. Large boats were 40 to 50
feet long, capable of carrying 40 to 50 men. While dugouts were admirably
suited for travel and trade between the Illini tribes along the
Illinois and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> rivers, they were, on account of their weight and
unwieldiness in portaging, generally useless in raids against enemies.</p>

<h3>Marriage Customs and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Family">Family</a></h3>
<p>An Illini man, desiring to get married, sent presents to the girl&rsquo;s
parents. If the suitor was acceptable, the parents kept the gift and
took the bride to the man&rsquo;s hut the following evening. Apparently there
was no wedding ceremony.</p>
<p>Women had somewhat lower social <a class="gloss" href="#g_Status">status</a> than their husbands.
Wives did not eat with their husbands. A man was permitted two or
more wives and often married two sisters. Children were well-treated.
Infants were bound to a cradle board that the mother carried around.
The cradle was pointed at the lower end and was stuck in the ground
when the woman wanted to rest. Divorce was accomplished by a simple
agreement to separate.</p>
<h3><a class="gloss" href="#g_PoliticalOrganization">Political Organization</a></h3>
<p>The explorers and writers to whom we are indebted for our knowledge
of Illini social and religious organization were, unfortunately, casual
and untrained observers who, on the whole, held the Indian and his
customs in contempt. Important activities were often dismissed with
meaningless generalizations, or omitted entirely, as if generally known.
Consequently great gaps are left in the information that has come down
to us.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_48">48</div>
<p>From the various accounts, the impression is given that the Illini
tribes (and possibly before the 17th century, the Confederacy) had a
political government (rather than <i><a class="gloss" href="#g_FamilyTypeSocialControl">family social control</a></i>) with formally
appointed officers or civil chiefs. The Confederacy had one or more
coats-of-arms (&ldquo;totems&rdquo;) that may have been recognized abroad as
symbolic of the Illini (as was customary among the Natchez and other
southeastern Indians). It had a Grand <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">Chief</a>, chosen in some manner
not now known, from one of the constituent tribes. At one <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>
&ldquo;Prince Tamaroa&rdquo; of the Tamaroas held the post, later Chief Ducoigne
of the Kaskaskias. Whether or not the Confederacy acted as a nation
after 1600 is doubtful. Each tribe had its own head chief and coat-of-arms,
and the French appear to have treated directly with the tribal
heads in matters of importance. Judging from other Indian Confederations,
the individual tribe had probably retained its full powers, and
concerted action by the Confederacy was possible only by unanimous
consent.</p>
<p>Like most peoples in the simple plant-raising <a class="gloss" href="#g_Status">status</a>, the tribe dealt
as a state with other similar units in intertribal affairs. These included
alliances and treaties of peace. Ambassadors or tribal representatives
were sent from Illini tribes to their neighbors. On such occasions,
the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calumet">calumet</a> was carried and served as a safe conduct.<a class="fn" id="fr_19" href="#fn_19">[19]</a> Tribal representatives
met approaching strangers (and presumably the ambassadors
of another tribe), raising the highly adorned calumet (and pipe) toward
the sun as they advanced. Smoking the calumet&mdash;by the contracting
tribal agents at the conclusion of an agreement&mdash;corresponded to our
signatures and seals at the end of a written treaty.</p>
<p>Each village probably had a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Chief">chief</a>, whose power (it was sometimes
reported) was little. However, the chiefs wore, as badges of office, red
scarfs woven of bear and buffalo hair. Their faces were painted red.
The village men (or possibly the important men) met before the
village chief&rsquo;s cabin or in a large hut built especially for gatherings to
deliberate on political or religious matters. The entire village often
seems to have been in audience.</p>
<p>If there were social classes among the Illini, no mention is made
of it in early reports. Men acquired prestige mainly through skillful
hunting or success in fighting. The leader in a raid had to recompense
the families of any followers killed in the fighting.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_49">49</div>
<p>With so little description of the village and tribal assemblies and
the chiefs in deliberation and judgment, it is difficult to determine the
exact <a class="gloss" href="#g_Status">status</a> of <a class="gloss" href="#g_PoliticalOrganization">political organization</a> of the tribe and its officers. It
may well be that the powers of the chiefs immediately after European
contact were small, and that in order to deal with the agency of a
European state, the Illini found it necessary (as did the Delaware
tribes) to grant greater authority and responsibility to their political leaders.
It is probably also true that the chiefs would, under pressure
from the whites, be reluctant to take responsibility for an unpopular
concession and would declare that only the tribal council or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Assemblage">assemblage</a>
could confirm the agreement under consideration. In any case, the
Illini were on the threshold of true political control if they had not
actually adopted it.</p>
<h3>Raids</h3>
<p>The tribe in historic times seems to have been the war-making
group. Raiding parties tried to sneak undetected into enemy country
and conceal themselves. From their hiding place, they fell suddenly
on small unsuspecting enemy bodies, scalping men, killing women and
children, and slipping away again with a few prisoners if practicable.
Back in the village, captive warriors were bound to a frame of green
wood, suspended over a slow fire, and tortured until death released
them. Warriors hung the scalps taken upon their cabins as evidence of
their prowess. The Illini claimed not to have tortured or burned captives
until their men had been taken and so treated by Iroquois raiding
parties. On the <a class="gloss" href="#g_War">war</a> path warriors carried bundles containing objects
sacred to their guardian spirits and invoked them frequently to obtain
victory.</p>
<p>Bows and arrows in quivers, hatchets or tomahawks, clubs, and
&ldquo;arrowproof&rdquo; shields consisting of several layers of buffalo hide were
carried on raids. The bow and arrow was considered superior to the gun
because it could &ldquo;fire&rdquo; more rapidly.</p>
<h3>Trade</h3>
<p>Earlier in the European <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>, the Illini furnished Canadians with
skins of beaver, raccoon, deer, bear and buffalo, but in 1776 the French
(in Illinois) compelled them &ldquo;to devote themselves to producing oil,
tallow and meat which they traded with them.&rdquo; (Deliette Memoir.
See Pease in Bibliography under ILLINI.) The Indians traded for
porcupine quills with more northern neighbors. After the European
came, Illini trade was probably overwhelmingly with the whites, exchanging
native products of the forest for coveted guns, iron knives,
hatchets, brass kettles, cloth, glass beads and alcoholic liquors.</p>

</div>
<h3><a class="gloss" href="#g_Religion">Religion</a></h3>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Religion">religion</a> of the early historic Illini was apparently a complex
one. The sun was evidently a powerful deity from whom the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Calumet">calumet</a>
pipe had perhaps been supposedly received. A special calumet, apparently
sacred to the sun, was revered as a palladium (like the Hebraic
Ark of the Covenant) on which rested the safety of the nation. A
special official had responsibility for its safe keeping. The smoke of the
pipe was offered to the sun whenever the Illini prayed for rain, fine
weather, or some other aid. Whether the Grand Manitou (Great
Spirit), whom the French thought was the Supreme God of the Illini,
was identical with the sun is not known though it seems probable.</p>
<p>In addition to the above gods, the Illini believed in numerous
spirits and in reincarnation. A young man sought to secure a spirit as
his superhuman helper or guardian for life. He fasted and prayed to
the spirit to come to him in a vision. If successful (as he usually was),
the spirit appeared to him in a dream and gave him instructions for a
ritual by which he kept in contact with his protector. The objects
needed for the ritual he collected on awakening and preserved them
thereafter in a roll of painted matting. When calling upon his spirit
protector, the bundle was opened and the rite performed, chiefly prayers
and smoke offerings from a pipe blown toward the bundle.</p>
<p>It seems probable that there were true priests who were appointed
by regular procedure and who received their power by virtue of their
installation into office. The priests, we are told, painted themselves all
over with clay on which designs were drawn. Their faces were painted
with red, white, blue, yellow, green and black colors. The &ldquo;high <a class="gloss" href="#g_Priest">priest</a>&rdquo;
wore a bonnet or crown of feathers and a pair of horns, possibly young
deer or buffalo.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_51">51</div>
<p>Medicine men also seem to have existed, persons who sought power
from spirits to use in behalf of others for private gain or a livelihood.
Possibly they were interested on the side in black magic or witchcraft,
an anti-social activity.</p>
<p>Dancing, probably singing, and supplication, together with the
inevitable smoke offerings from a ceremonial pipe doubtless formed a
large part of public worship for which the whole community assembled.
Details of the Illini ceremonies and their meanings are not known.</p>
<p>The French priests severely denounced native religious customs
and &ldquo;juggleries&rdquo; of the Illini. The Peoria chiefs and priests resented this
and resisted Christian attempts to convert the tribe (1693).</p>
<p>Funeral and burial customs seem to have been generally similar to
those of other plant-raising peoples. All dead were treated with respect,
decked in their best apparel, painted in preparation for burial. A dance
was performed in honor of the deceased. A skin stretched over a large
pot formed a drum which was beaten with a single stick as accompaniment
for the dance. The participants were rewarded with presents at
the conclusion of the dance. The gifts to be distributed were displayed
in full view of the dancers and the duration of the dance was determined
by their relative richness. An important personage was given
special consideration and the whole community probably attended the
funeral. Corn and a pot to boil it in were placed beside the dead.
Friends standing around the grave threw into it bracelets, pendants and
&ldquo;pieces of earthenware&rdquo; (pots?). The graves of chiefs were marked by
a painted wooden post taller than the markers for ordinary <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a>.
Illini chiefs and persons of distinction as a signal honor were placed in
tree-tops in a coffin made of bark. The tribe danced and sang for
twenty-four hours during the funeral of a distinguished man.</p>

<h3><a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">Art</a></h3>
<p>Men tattooed their &ldquo;whole bodies.&rdquo; They painted themselves in
solid colors and with designs in red, black, yellow, blue, and other
colors. The body was adorned with native <a class="gloss" href="#g_Jewelry">jewelry</a>, the nose and ears
<span class="pb" id="Page_52">52</span>
were pierced for ornaments, and feathers of many colors were worn
attached to the scalp lock. Moccasins were decorated with porcupine
quill embroidery. Men clipped or shaved most of the head, leaving
the scalp lock and four other tufts of long hair, two on each side, one
in front of and behind each ear. After European trade goods were
available, glass beads and cloth were obtainable in considerable quantities
and largely replaced native dress materials and ornaments.</p>
<p>The Illini played lacrosse, an athletic game. The straw-and-bean
game was a game of chance in which the players each took a number
of straws from a bundle. The straws in each hand were discarded by
sixes, the number left determining the winner of the round. Beans
were used as counters. The Illini made wagers as to the outcome, even
putting up their sisters as stakes in the game.</p>

<h3><a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">Archaeology</a> of the Illini</h3>
<p>Two village sites of the Illini have been investigated by the Illinois
State Museum, one near Utica, LaSalle County (jointly with the University
of Chicago) and one in Randolph County near the mouth of the
Kaskaskia River. This last site was occupied for over a century by
descendants of the Kaskaskias and other Illini tribes. Except for a
small area where <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> are found, it is a &ldquo;pure&rdquo; site.</p>
<p>The Illini tools, weapons and ornaments of native make were the
usual chipped <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a> triangular <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arrowheads">arrowheads</a>, simple flint drills and scrapers,
<a class="gloss" href="#g_RoughStone">rough stone</a> hammers and abrading stones, small ground <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> pendants,
polished stone &ldquo;Micmac&rdquo; or &ldquo;keel-based&rdquo; pipe bowls (many of
catlinite), the long-stemmed L-shaped catlinite pipes (sometimes called
&ldquo;Siouan&rdquo;), and cut and engraved bone ornaments. An arrowshaft
straightener carries an etching of a buffalo cow. Pottery is rare, but
the pieces found in association with European trade goods are characteristically
Middle Mississippian.</p>

<p>The Illini made <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> from fragments of European materials,
iron spear- and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Arrowheads">arrowheads</a>, brass and chipped glass arrowheads, brass
pendants, and beads of broken porcelain.</p>
<p>European trade materials far exceed in number the native products.
Usually they are fragmentary (except for colored glass beads of many
kinds): parts of copper and brass kettles, iron handles, gun hammers
and other parts, lead balls and the molds for making them, molds for
casting crosses and ornaments, iron spoons, kitchen and clasp knife
blades of iron, &ldquo;Dutch&rdquo; white pottery pipes, scissors, jew&rsquo;s-harps, bottles
for wine and olive oil, brass buttons and finger rings.</p>
<p>The Illini seem to have cast lead into musket balls and chipped gun
flints into shape but beyond that made no attempt to learn machine-age
technologies. For firearms, gunpowder, iron knives and hatchets
they were wholly dependent on the white invaders, a great disadvantage
in event of hostilities and one that eventually cost them ownership of
their ancient homelands.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_54">54</div>
<h2 id="c12">THE INDIANS LEAVE ILLINOIS</h2>
<p>For historic tribes of the state other than the Illini little is known
of their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a>. Culturally it is almost a certainty that all were,
soon after contact, largely disorganized due to partial economic dependence,
European diseases and the alcohol trade, to diminishing
game, loss of other resources, and to military pressures from white
governments and contiguous Indian groups.</p>
<p>Only the broad outlines of the movements of the historic tribes
that lived, hunted, or made forays in Illinois need to be noted here.
The Iroquois, Winnebago and Chickasaw made no attempts to permanently
occupy Illinois territory as a result of their raids.</p>
<p>The Illini came under French influence after 1673 and leaned
heavily on their military support. At times the Illini warriors fought
bravely alongside the French, but generally they had little stomach for
fighting even in their own defense. They shifted their settlements frequently
after the Iroquois attack of 1680 and later under repeated pressure
by the Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo and Potawatomi, who invaded and
occupied the northern part of Illini territory.</p>
<p>Due to their dwindling courage and lack of incentive, more perhaps
than to their losses in enemy raids, the Illini tribes decreased
rapidly in numbers and importance. When they were removed to the
west of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> in 1832, the population of the once great Illini
Confederacy totalled little more than one hundred persons.</p>
<p>Even before this, the Miami had been pushed out of Illinois due
to inroads of the Kickapoo and Potawatomi. The Shawnee, too, probably
abandoned their permanent settlements in southern Illinois early
in the contact <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> though these lower counties may have still been
considered their territory. Other groups did not settle or hunt there
and the Shawnee did establish some villages there (e.g. Shawneetown)
briefly in the eighteenth century. Bands of Shawnee continued to hunt
in this region until 1828 or later.</p>
<p>The Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo and Potawatomi did not long enjoy the
territory they had wrested from the Illini and Miami. Immediately after
the Black Hawk <a class="gloss" href="#g_War">War</a> in 1832, steps were taken to move all Indians from
the state. By the Treaty of Chicago, the Indians gave up all their lands
in Illinois, and in 1837 the last bands (Potawatomi) crossed to the western
bank of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. No land is reserved today in this state for
Indians. Its former resident tribes now live in reservations in Iowa,
Oklahoma, Kansas, Nebraska and in the state of Coahuila in Mexico.</p>
<h2 id="c13">SUMMARY OF ILLINOIS PREHISTORY</h2>
<p>The <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaeology">archaeology</a> of Illinois in its present position seems to indicate
that the state did not at any time form a distinct single <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> or <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a>
but that it was rather the meeting place of many, due possibly
to the rivers that enclose, lead to and intersect its territory. It was at
<span class="pb" id="Page_55">55</span>
one and the same time a part of one or more widespread patterns or
phases and a patchwork of subcultures that <a class="gloss" href="#g_Extended">extended</a> into neighboring
states. There was a tendency for the cultures of the northern four-fifths
of the state (roughly north of a line joining East St. Louis with Evansville,
Indiana) to be more like the adjacent regions, while those of the
remaining counties were more closely related to those of Kentucky,
Tennessee, southern Indiana and Missouri and rather readily distinguishable
from those of their northern neighbors.</p>
<p>There are few instances when it appears probable that a part of the
state was invaded by a <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> of a distinctly differing <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>. The
Paleo-Indian Big Game Hunters presumably found in Illinois virgin
country without previous human occupants. The Baumerians probably
entered Illinois from south of the Ohio and expelled or absorbed the
conservative Terminal Archaics. Possibly Mortonians intruded into the
Black Sand-Red Ocre culture of Illinois from the northwest. Less
plausibly, the <a class="gloss" href="#g_StoneVaultGrave">Stone Vault Grave</a> people may have pushed their way
into Adams County from the Gasconade River region of Missouri.</p>
<p>The emphasis in this paper has been placed perhaps on the change
of cultures. To keep one from getting an erroneous impression of
cultural stability, it should be said that, in the writer&rsquo;s opinion, a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a>
and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> contained in greater or smaller areas change gradually
through a process of invention here and there and through interchanges
of improvements back and forth over a long time. When the change
is sufficient to be noted as a &ldquo;new&rdquo; culture, the various cultural elements
or features are apt to be widely distributed over much the same area.
Thus, Baumer seems to have existed for a time alongside Terminal
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> but finally spread through the southern counties; Hopewellian
may have persisted in Calhoun County for a century or more after its
collapse to the north and east; and the <a class="gloss" href="#g_FinalPhase">Final phase</a> may have lingered
on in remote portions of the state until Cahokia was past the height of
its glory. In general, perhaps it could be said that the southern fifth
and the remaining four-fifths of the state were out of step with each
other most of the time.</p>
<p>As previously noted, some of the Paleo-Indian families, upon the
retreat of the last glacier, settled in Illinois as they did in the neighboring
states, adapted themselves to the changed surroundings, and in so
doing developed the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> or way of life. This <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">phase</a> developed
through a series of subcultures though not necessarily identical sequences
in all the states or even within Illinois. In southern Illinois,
Terminal Archaic seems to have persisted until about 2000 B.C. while
in the north, it apparently had developed into Initial (early) <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>
a few centuries earlier. The Baumer <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a>, probably arising from
the Archaic of Tennessee, appears to have been carried by its bearers
into southeastern Illinois along the Tennessee and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cumberland">Cumberland</a> rivers.
Although widespread in the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> Valley, the Archaic population
was thinly scattered.</p>
<div class="pb" id="Page_56">56</div>
<p>In northern Illinois and in Wisconsin the Black Sand-Red Ochre
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> seems to have developed from the native Terminal <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> (and
Old Copper) possibly around 2500 B.C. The Morton (Central Basin)
<a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> appear to have had their cultural roots outside the state and to
have combined with the native groups (Black Sand-Red Ochre) they
found in the northern counties. Average populational distribution was
still low with the small settlements perhaps somewhat more numerous
though no more populous than during Archaic times. The early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>
peoples differed from their predecessors mainly in being pottery-makers.
In southern Illinois only they practiced storage of acorns and
hickory nuts extensively.</p>
<p>About 500 B.C. in northern Illinois the Morton <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> more or
less contemporaneously with similarly advanced peoples in Iowa, Wisconsin,
Indiana, Michigan and Ohio, passed into the Hopewellian
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">civilization</a> which was erected on the cultivation of maize, beans,
squash and tobacco, and the technologies of the earlier <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a>. In southern Illinois Baumer developed into the <a class="gloss" href="#g_CrabOrchard">Crab Orchard</a>
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> whose people traded with the more northern Hopewellians,
intermarried with them and finally adopted the Hopewellian way of life
about 100 B.C.</p>
<p>A century or two later, Hopewellian in the north of Illinois began
to deteriorate and eventually broke up into a number of small subcultures,
obviously closely related but still distinguishable archaeologically.
The same disintegration of Hopewellian took place in southern
Illinois a few centuries later, and by 400 or 450 B.C. Hopewellian had
disappeared from all Illinois except possibly in Calhoun County in the
west, while south of the Ohio River it still continued to spread and
flourish in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> and Louisiana for some centuries.</p>
<p>In Illinois a <a class="gloss" href="#g_Period">period</a> of decadence set in for the next few centuries
(possibly 250 to 1000 A.D.). The larger settlements or settlement
clusters dwindled to mere hamlets, whose remains are scarcely distinguishable
from the early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> except that the tobacco
pipe is present. Though they must still have retained a tradition of
<a class="gloss" href="#g_PlantRaising">plant-raising</a>, they seem to have avoided it and reverted to a pure
hunting-collecting <a class="gloss" href="#g_Economy">economy</a>. Even in southern Illinois the storage of
food seems to have played an insignificant role. Nevertheless throughout
this cultural recession, certain trends occur in all the six Final Woodland subcultures which
foreshadow later developments in the
Middle (<a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>) <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">Phase</a>.</p>

<p>About 1000 A.D. or possibly a little earlier, the Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>
developed into an early Protomississippi (<a class="gloss" href="#g_Protomiss">Protomiss</a>) and, at last,
(possibly 1000 to 1100 A.D.) into the full-blown <a class="gloss" href="#g_MiddlePhase">Middle Phase</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Civilization">civilization</a>.
The Cahokia <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> appears to be primarily, though not exclusively,
Illinoisian while the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Cumberland">Cumberland</a> development in the southeast
of the state was shared more generously with adjacent Indiana,
Kentucky and Tennessee. Judging by the distribution of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> box
(cist) graves, the Cumberland subculture seems to have expanded
westward at the expense of the Cahokia peoples to envelope most of
the southern counties from Monroe to White. (Another interpretation
might be that the grave type of their eastern Cumberland neighbors
was adopted by the Cahokians.) The Crable Village, possibly a late
Cahokian settlement, yields <a class="gloss" href="#g_Artifacts">artifacts</a> suggesting cultural influences
brought in from Iowa, Missouri and possibly Arkansas. It is probable
that the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> came to an end in Illinois by 1500 or 1550. This fact
coupled with the pottery evidence makes it highly probable (though
possibly not conclusive) that the disorganized Illini Confederacy embraced
the tribes whose members were the descendants of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a>
of the great Middle Phase civilization in Illinois.</p>
<p>More or less contemporaneous with the <a class="gloss" href="#g_MiddlePhase">Middle Phase</a> <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> were
the so-called Upper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">Phase</a> peoples of Missouri, Iowa, Wisconsin,
Michigan and Indiana. These were represented in Illinois by the Fisher
peoples of the Langford <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> known chiefly from sites along the
Illinois, Kankakee and Des Plaines rivers in northeastern Illinois and
(chiefly on a pottery basis) in northwestern Indiana and southern
Michigan.</p>
<p>Beset by enemies on the east, south, north and northwest, with
their traditions of former greatness fading, the demoralized Illini tribes
welcomed the protection of French soldiers. Their own resourcefulness,
courage, pride, and confidence in themselves and their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> continued
to deteriorate, their numbers to diminish under the softening
influence of alcohol and the persistent assaults of the ruder more
aggressive Winnebago, Sauk, Fox, Potawatomi and Kickapoo tribes
invading Illinois from the north until they were reduced by 1833 to
a mere handful of a hundred odd men, women and children. The demands
on the part of citizens of the United States for Illinois lands
was brought to a head by the scare of the Black Hawk <a class="gloss" href="#g_War">War</a>, and the
Illini, their traditional Indian friends and enemies, were transferred to
new territory west of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a>. Thus ended the aboriginal occupation
of Illinois that had endured for at least 10,000 years.</p>

</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_6" href="#fr_6">[6]</a>These dates and those given hereafter refer to the earliest and latest sites known in Illinois for the cultures under consideration. Although supported by radiocarbon dating methods, they are only approximate. Undoubtedly also cultures in one area disappeared while they continued to flourish in another part of the state or in other states.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_7" href="#fr_7">[7]</a>Generally speaking, each succeeding higher <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> in the area made most of
the tool and weapon types of their predecessors, adding certain improvements and
sometimes new types. The Archaic <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> used <a class="gloss" href="#g_Flint">flint</a> scrapers, chipped flint choppers,
and native cobblestone hammers as had the Paleo-Indians. The narrow-bladed
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Spearheads">spearheads</a> were occasionally made but the fluting or channel is practically always
lacking. Polished <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> forms, possibly the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Spearthrower">spearthrower</a>, were new inventions in
Archaic times.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_8" href="#fr_8">[8]</a>In the page that follows a tentative reconstruction of the less tangible customs of these <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> will be presented, based on a study of several tribes now or recently in the Archaic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Status">status</a>. The Archaic <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> as used in this paper refers to those tribes who lived mainly by hunting, supplemented to a degree by collecting native edible plant foods. They are distinguished here from other peoples of the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">Stone</a> Age or non-farming <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a>&mdash;from Big Game Hunters on the one hand (none of whom exist today) and on the other, from Food Stores, who were able by one means or another to store food over one or more seasons and so establish more or less fixed homes. The peoples recently living in the Archaic status include the native tribes of Central and Coastal Australia, the Tasmanians, the Andaman Island tribes, the Terra del Fuegians, the African Bushmen and a number of others.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_9" href="#fr_9">[9]</a>The Initial Woodland in Illinois is usually considered to consist of three cultural divisions or units, the Black Sand, the Red Ochre and the Morton. The only known Red Ochre sites are mounds which undoubtedly are the burial places of important personages of a cultural group whose campsites and artifact assemblages have not as yet been identified as such. The graves yield a number of artifact types that are identical with those found in Black Sand villages. It is possible the Red Ochre mounds belong to the Black Sand <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a> and that the mounds and special burial customs may have been continued into or adopted by the Morton cultural group and served still later as a framework for the highly elaborated Hopewellian funeral practices.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_10" href="#fr_10">[10]</a>The narrow-bladed leaf-shaped spearhead, well-chipped and without fluting,
reminiscent of the general Yuma, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Folsom">Folsom</a> and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Clovis">Clovis</a> shape, are found in the Red
Ochre <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> and are worthy of note. This type appears rarely in campsites
but occurs in relatively large numbers in mounds. Profuse amounts of red ochre
are found in graves as in Terminal Archaic (Titterington focus) in western Illinois.
Copper ornaments may indicate Wisconsin (Old Copper <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">Culture</a>) influence.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_11" href="#fr_11">[11]</a>The Poole village (Pike County) is dated 550 B.C. and the Wilson <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mound">Mound</a>
(White County) about 89 B.C. The Poole village appears to have been occupied
from 550 B.C. to 200 A.D.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_12" href="#fr_12">[12]</a>Civilization, as used in this paper, signifies exhaustive exploitation of the natural resources and accompanying significant elaborations of the social and spiritual aspects (as exemplified by ceremonies, regalia, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Insigne">insignia</a>, <a class="gloss" href="#g_Art">art</a> and extensive architectural structures), accomplished by means of <a class="gloss" href="#g_Specialization">specialization</a> of the existing tools and technologies, with or without fundamental inventive developments. Artisans of the Initial and Final <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a> cultures seem to have practiced all the crafts employed by Hopewellians but failed to produce the beautiful chipped <a class="gloss" href="#g_Spearheads">spearheads</a>, &ldquo;pipes of pan&rdquo;, excellent sculpture in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a> and pottery, etching in bone, the extensive earthworks and the mounds with timbered burial chambers. Perhaps some additional stimuli&mdash;the introduction of maize or the intensification of its cultivation, a satisfying new <a class="gloss" href="#g_Religion">religion</a> with stirring ceremonies together with intergroup competition&mdash;gave the spiritual impetus that produced the Hopewellian fluorescence.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_13" href="#fr_13">[13]</a>Specialization was foreshadowed in the Red Ochre <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> but the small
total of grave offerings discovered to date fail to demonstrate any greater leisure
than occurs at favorable times among any simple hunting <a class="gloss" href="#g_People">people</a>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_14" href="#fr_14">[14]</a>An early <a class="gloss" href="#g_Subculture">subculture</a> termed Old Village preceding the generally known
Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> (Trappist or Bean Pot) period has been proposed on the
strength of stratification at the Cahokia village near East St. Louis. Although this
appears logically sound, the evidence has not been published and no pure Old
Village site has yet been found and reported upon.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_15" href="#fr_15">[15]</a>Except where noted as based directly on archaeological evidence, the broad
cultural features suggested in the rest of this section, are inferred from similar
customs found generally among tribes in the plant-raising <a class="gloss" href="#g_Status">status</a> without food-draft
animals. The results were derived by the writer from a study of anthropological
reports of the following tribes or groups of tribes: Polynesians, Delawares, Natchez
(and their neighbors) and the western Pueblo Indians. The Pueblos, in their social,
political and religious customs and <a class="gloss" href="#g_Institutions">institutions</a> have been for seven hundred years
in a transitional status between the <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> hunters (or possibly &ldquo;<a class="gloss" href="#g_FoodStorers">food storers</a>&rdquo;)
and a &ldquo;fully-developed&rdquo; plant-raising <a class="gloss" href="#g_Stage">stage</a>.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_16" href="#fr_16">[16]</a>The archaeological evidence for this section is chiefly from <i>The Fisher <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mound">Mound</a>
Group</i>, etc. by George Langford in the AMERICAN <a class="gloss" href="#g_Anthropology">ANTHROPOLOGY</a>, Vol.
XXIX, No. 3, pp. 153-205 (July-September, 1927).
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_17" href="#fr_17">[17]</a>These Indians called themselves Ilini (pronounced Il&acute;-i-nee) or Illini signifying &ldquo;man,&rdquo; in the plural Illiniwek, &ldquo;the men.&rdquo; The French dropped the -iwek and substituted their own ending whence the name Illinois by which they were generally known thereafter. In this booklet Illini will be generally used to designate these tribes, their <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> and language to avoid confusion with other tribes who, like the Sauk, Fox, Kickapoo, Potawatomi, and Miami, have occupied parts of the state and are sometimes called Illinois Indians.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_18" href="#fr_18">[18]</a>Information given on historic tribes is from notes and manuscript assembled
by Dr. Wayne C. Temple.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_19" href="#fr_19">[19]</a>The term <i>calumet</i>, originally applied to the stem of the tobacco pipe, is
now generally used to designate the pipe and stem. &ldquo;It is fashioned from a red
<a class="gloss" href="#g_Stone">stone</a>, polished like marble, and bored in such a manner that one end serves as
a receptacle for the tobacco, while the other fits into the stem; this is a stick two
feet long, as thick as an ordinary cane, and bored through the middle. It is
ornamented with the heads and necks of various birds, whose plumage is very
beautiful. To these they also add large feathers&mdash;red, green, and other colors&mdash;wherewith
the whole is adorned. They have a great regard for it....&rdquo; (R. G.
Thwaites, ed., <i>The Jesuit Relations</i>, Vol. LIX, p. 131.) The <a class="gloss" href="#g_War">war</a> calumet differed
from that of peace and was decorated with red feathers. See <a href="#fig34">Fig. 34</a>, A.
</div><div class="fndef"><a class="fn"  id="fn_20" href="#fr_20">[20]</a>Artifact types having once appeared are likely to appear again in subsequent <a class="gloss" href="#g_Culture">culture</a> even though rare or even lacking in some intervening
assemblages (e.g. necklaces of anculosa beads of similarly ground [snail] <a class="gloss" href="#g_Shells">shells</a> found from Medial <a class="gloss" href="#g_Archaic">Archaic</a> through Middle <a class="gloss" href="#g_Phase">Phase</a>; grooved axes from
Medial Archaic to <a class="gloss" href="#g_Mississippi">Mississippi</a> but rare or lacking in most subcultures and cultures except Archaic and
Initial <a class="gloss" href="#g_Woodland">Woodland</a>). On account of unwieldiness of complete accumulative lists only new artifact types when they first appear will
be recorded here. Exceptions: 1) the name of an artifact entered as probably present (indicated by a following ?) will be repeated
in the first subsequent culture in which definite evidence for it has been reported and 2) when an artifact once reported
assumes a new form or presumably takes on a new significance (e.g. Archaic hoe becomes a tool of the plant-raisers in <a class="gloss" href="#g_Classic">Classic</a> and
Middle Phases), it will appear again in the text.

* You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
  the use of Project Gutenberg-tm works calculated using the method
  you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
  to the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm trademark, but he has
  agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
  Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
  within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are

  Literary Archive Foundation."

* You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
  you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
  does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg-tm
  License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
  copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
  all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg-tm
  works.

  any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
  electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
  receipt of the work.

* You comply with all other terms of this agreement for free
  distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm works.

1.E.9. If you wish to charge a fee or distribute a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work or group of works on different terms than
are set forth in this agreement, you must obtain permission in writing
from both the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation and The
Project Gutenberg Trademark LLC, the owner of the Project Gutenberg-tm
trademark. Contact the Foundation as set forth in Section 3 below.

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg-tm collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain "Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.

1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the "Right
of Replacement or Refund" described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg-tm trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg-tm electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.

1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.

1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg-tm
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg-tm work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg-tm work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
